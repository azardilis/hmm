* make BaumWelch function more presentable
** replace 'magic' numbers with uniform probs
** add another stopping condition for dL(difference in likelihood)

* suggestion for alternative emission distribution
** experiment with binomials, normal approximations to it
** read paper about possible parameterisations(p of Binomial coming from normal based on
state
** possible parameter estimation schemes?
